                </b>
              </p>

              <p>"Hi my name is Tunde Olariwanju</p>

              <p>
                On the 30th of March 2019, I wasn't feeling so good at work so I
                decided to take my leave. <br />
                On my way outside my workplace I had a heart attack.
              </p>

              <p>
                My colleague at work rushed to check up on me.<br />
                They insisted on taking me to the hospital but I refused because
                I didn't think it was anything serious paracetamol couldn't fix.
              </p>

              <p>
                I got home feeling dizzy and having a serious headache. <br />
                I didn't tell my wife about what happened at work that day
                because I didn't want to scare her.
              </p>

              <p>
                i started feeling pressure on my head and i was having a hard
                time sleeping,
              </p>

              <p>I took paracetamol and it all went down that night.</p>

              <p>
                I decided to go to the hospital the next day to ask my doctor
                what was wrong with me, then my doctor ran a series of test and
                it came out that my blood pressure number were up the roof, the
                result were unbelivable i was recording a <b> 160/90 mm Hg </b>
              </p>

              <p>
                The doctor told me if I had delayed visiting the hospital by a
                few more days, I would be putting myself between life and death.
              </p>

              <p>My wife and I got scared immediately after hearing this.</p>

              <p>
                The doctor prescribed the medicine to use and the list of food
                to avoid for my health.
              </p>

              <p>He also advised me to watch my weight and workout more.</p>

              <p>
                I listened carefully to every advice the doctor gave thinking I
                would never experience this whole thing again.
              </p>

              <p>
                But it appeared to have no effect at all. <br />
                Weekly checks at the hospital showed that the rise in my blood
                pressure was not dropping.
              </p>

              <p>
                I stopped living my normal life, I had to stop work because of
                my loss of vision,I couldn't see properly.
              </p>

              <p>all of these happened for months without a solution !!!</p>

              <p>
                I was feeling terrible and i was about to give up, i didn't know
                what else to do i have tried everything possible
              </p>

              <p>
                On one faithful day, my wife's childhood friend who just got
                back from India decided to pay us a visit.
              </p>

              <p>
                She and my wife hadn't seen each other for close to 10 years, it
                was a day my wife has been looking forward to.
              </p>

              <p>
                Then we started talking and she told me about a solution that
                most Indians use ‘Two secret Indian herb’ that wasn't common to
                anybody.
              </p>

              <p>
                I had lost hope because my doctor could help me out, but my
                wife's friend insisted that I watch this video which got me
                really convinced that this would work.
              </p>
              <p>
                After much persuasion I finally gave in and watched the video
                and it was looking promising because the doctor has helped his
                patients manage to get rid of their high blood pressure in all
                cases.<br />
                I decided to follow what the doctor had said and try out his
                method.
              </p>

              <p>
                I used it for the first 2 weeks and I didn't see any changes.<br />
                I thought this was it, I started to think this was another fake
                product but I continued using it cause the product doesn't give
                any side effects.<br />At the end of the third week i started
                seeing some changes and my blood pressure dropping a little.<br />Well
                that is some improvement but I wasn't still completely convinced
                that it works.
              </p>

              <p>Boom!!! Boom !!!</p>
              <p>
                The very fourth week, things started changing in my life so
                fast.
              </p>

              <p>
                I decided to see my doctor and explain to him what has been
                going in the past week
              </p>

              <p>
                and he decided to run some tests on me and he was surprised to
                see that my blood pressure was dropping significantly. I was
                reading <b>“120/90mmHg”</b>.
              </p>

              <p>After 4 weeks I stopped feeling dizzy and unusual headache.</p>

              <p>
                I got my life back through the video my wife's friend sent to
                me.
              </p>

              <p>I am always and forever grateful to her till this day"</p>

              <p>
                If you want to know the video that helped me stabilize my BP
